A simple snake game made with python

This is my first personal project, created as a way to put in pratice what I learned in the first semester of university.
Its very simple but quite fun, if you want to run it you need to have pygame installed (pip install pygame). You can execute the file with python and then the path to the file, like: python ./Downloads/snake_game.py

control the snake with the arrow keys, have fun :)
